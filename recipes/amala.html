    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Bucnch of Ewedu (Jute) Leaves</li>  
   <li>2 cups of water </li>
   <li>1 Tablespoon of Locust Beans (Iru)</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon of crayfish</li>
   <li>2 cube of maggi</li>
   <li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
   <li>Yam Flour</li>
   <li>Water</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Steps in Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick your Ewedu leaves, make sure you don’t pick the stalk/stem along with it.</li>
  <li>Wash the leaves thoroughly to rid it of dirt. Pour the water into a medium size pan, place on a bob on medium heat, bring to a rolling boil.</li>
<li>using a blender, take the Ewedu off the heat and leave to cool for a bit…don’t switch the heat off.</li>
<li>Add the Ewedu into a blender along with the Iru, make sure you don’t add all the water, just 1/2 a cup should do. Too much water will affect the viscosity of your Ewedu.</li>
<li>Using the pulse function, pulse a few times till you get a semi-purée consistency.</li>
<li>Transfer the Ewedu back into the pan, add the ground crayfish, bouillon cube and salt to taste.
</li>
<li>Switch off the heat and let it simmer with the residual heat for 3 minutes….stir occasionally to prevent burning. Do not over cook or the Ewedu will go brown.</li>
<li>Pour water in a pot and allow to get hot, add the yam flour into it and stir continuously using a wooden stick to avoid lumps.</li>
<li>Add extra yam flour if watery or add some water if it’s too strong (just like the way your make your semovita).</li>
<li>Turn the yam flour very well, then add a bit of water, cover and allow to cook for about 10mins, then Wrap it up in nylon.</li>
